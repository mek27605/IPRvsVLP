# IPRvsVLP

In order to calculate the IPR and VLP curve in python, 
First you need to find the fluid properties under the current pressure or temperature values. 
Once the properties of fluid are established, now we can continue with the calculation of pressure drop gradient from the Beggs and Brill method.
After finding the gradient of pressure drop, it is easy to calculate the bottomhole pressures for different rates. Finally we can plot the VLP curve.
Then we can calculate the IPR curve by entering the other reservoir properties. After entering everything accurate, the IPR curve will be plotted.
